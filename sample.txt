welcome to git commands training

test


git status
This command returns the current state of the repository.
git status will return the current working branch. If a file is in the staging area, but not committed, it shows with git status. Or, if there are no changes it’ll return nothing to commit, working directory clean.

Usage:
$ git status 

In Practice:
# Message when no change
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean
